# Loop Machine

This loop machine creates sound based on loops.
You can activate a loop by pressing him one time, while play button is on. 
If you activate a loop while other loop is running the next loop will delay until the first one is finished. 
You can pause the loop by deactivating him or pressing pause to deativate all of them at once. 

Enjoy!
